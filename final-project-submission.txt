Final Project Submission

My Final Project was a Brain-Wave MIDI controller. I utilized a MindFlex
Brain Wave scanner and converted it to MIDI-CC. These MIDI-CC messages
were then sent via the Adafruit TinyUSB to a plugin host (VCV Rack) that
generated weird sounds given an audio input.

You can find a detailed report, source code, and broken c++ header files
at the following repository:
