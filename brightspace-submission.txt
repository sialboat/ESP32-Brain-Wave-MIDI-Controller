All code (test .ino projects and the .ino project) has been archived at the 
GitHub repository listed below. We were able to successfully get MIDI out of
tinyUSB and the hardware to communicate with the MEAP.

Next steps involve implementing random processes and interpolation infrastructure,
creating a sound texture generator, and to add Serial communication via CDC in
tinyUSB.
